  # Specify the number of chunks to break each fasta file into. Here the default is 2, which is
  # optimal for a fasta of 2.5 million HiFi reads. Smaller files can run faster with fewer 
  # chunks (e.g., 1). Larger files (consisting of multiple sequencing cells) may benefit 
  # from more chunks, but 9 is the absolute upper limit for any workflow (10 will cause errors).
  # Using a chunk size of 1 means the entire fasta file will be used.
  # DO NOT OVER SPLIT your fasta file, or this workflow will run substantially slower.

  # We recommend downloading the NCBI nt database from: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz*
  # Please note the gzipped nt database as of July 2020 was 82GB in size.
  # The database should be indexed using: minimap2 -k 19 -w 10 -d mm2_nt_db.mmi nt.gz
  # The k and w settings are specific to this pipeline.
  # This indexing can take several hours, and will result in a file that is ~860GB in size.

  # possible values = readCount, readLength, alignedBases, readMagnitude

  # Minimum support as percent of assigned reads. Default in MEGAN is 0.05, but with HiFi
  # the optimized value is 0.01. This provides a balanced trade-off between precision and recall
  # (based on mock community datasets), with near perfect detection of species down to 
  # ~0.04% abundance. To avoid any filtering based on this threshold, use a value of 0 
  # instead. This will report ALL assigned reads, which will include potentially thousands 
  # of false positives at ultra-low abundances (<0.01%), similar to results from 
  # short-read methods (e.g., Kraken2, Centrifuge, etc).

  # ****If your goal is to identify microbial contamination in targeted genome datasets, you
  # may want to set this higher in order to reduce false positives, with a value of >40-50. There 
  # are often small matches to poor quality bacterial references, and this would eliminate those.
